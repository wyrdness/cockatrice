## Overview

The cockatrice is a legendary serpent with a rooster's head from medieval European folklore. Known for its deadly petrifying gaze, poisonous breath, and lethal touch, this creature was feared as one of the most dangerous monsters in medieval bestiaries.

Born from a yolkless egg laid by a seven-year-old rooster and incubated by a serpent or toad, the cockatrice combines avian and reptilian features into a deadly hybrid. Often conflated with the basilisk, the cockatrice is sometimes distinguished by having wings while the basilisk does not.

The creature features prominently in medieval literature, including Edmund Spenser's *Faerie Queene*, and remains a classic symbol of medieval monster lore, appearing in heraldry and modern fantasy works.

## Birth & Origin

### The Cockatrice Birth Myth

According to medieval lore, a cockatrice is born from a **yolkless egg** (sometimes called a "cock's egg") laid by a **seven-year-old rooster** and incubated by a **serpent or toad** on a dunghill.

**Variations:**
- Incubated by a toad
- Incubated by a serpent
