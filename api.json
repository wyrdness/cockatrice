      "full": "The cockatrice is a mythical creature from medieval European folklore, depicted as a two-legged dragon or serpent with a rooster's head and wings. Often conflated with the basilisk, the cockatrice is sometimes distinguished by having wings while the basilisk does not. Born from a yolkless egg laid by a rooster and incubated by a serpent or toad, the cockatrice possesses lethal powers including a petrifying gaze, poisonous breath, and deadly touch. Its weaknesses include weasels, its own reflection in a mirror, and the crow of a rooster. The creature features prominently in medieval bestiaries, heraldry, and literature."
